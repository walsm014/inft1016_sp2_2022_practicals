        <h3>Introduction to the iPhone</h3>
        <p>The iPhone was first announced by Steve Jobs at 2007’s Macworld conference, and
            would go on to become one of the most influential pieces of technology in history. The
            product featured a touch-activated 3.5-inch screen, similar to that of their previous iPod
            releases, and users would be able to make calls, play games and type messages with the
            tap of a finger. The iPhones that followed (iPhone 3G onwards) would have 3G, 4G and
            5G wireless Internet capabilities over time, meaning users could browse online as much
            as they wanted, wherever they were (Mickalowski et al., 2008). This was a major
            development in mobile phone history.</p>

        <h3>What made the iPhone Stand Out?/iOS - iPhone’s Specialized Operating System</h3>
        <p>
            Users loved that the iPhone served as a camera, gaming device, GPS, alarm clock,
            Internet browser and mobile phone all in one. The different possibilities the device
            offered provided instant gratification to users as they had access to entertainment and
            social interactions on demand. The device became so popular, so quickly, that even
            teachers and students in medical practice were using them to enhance their learning on
            patient care (Wallace, Clark &amp; White, 2012). With the iPhone (along with other touch-
            screen Apple products such as the iPad and iPod) came iOS, Apple’s touch-screen device
            operating system. Whilst the first version of iOS served as a basic support for the
            iPhone, the second version was an extreme breakthrough for smart technology as a
            whole, showing off an Apple-specific App Store with over 500 apps and a Maps app with
            walking directions to different locations. As the version history increased, the iPhone’s
            app displays changed, voice recognition called Siri along with new apps were released,
            storage solutions such as iCloud emerged, and card-based payment options such as
            Apple Pay were released (Costello, 2022).

        <h3>How has the iPhone solved real-world problems/How does it help people?</h3>
        <p>There is a plethora of real-world problems that the iPhone solved, and continue to solve
            to this day with newer, updated releases. Some researchers argue that smartphones
            cause humans to be ‘cognitive misers’, seeking out quick solutions by making the
            smartphone do their thinking for them (Barr et al., 2015), however, smartphones are a
            fantastic way to work smarter and not harder when wanting to find out information
            quickly. Concepts such as voice-recognition and tap-buttons to type are also an
            accessible alternative for people with disabilities, who may struggle with physical
            writing or typing on a computer. For regular users of the device, smartphones really are
            an extension of oneself and a part of one’s identity (Park &amp; Kaye, 2018).</p>
